Hello, welcome to my personal academic website! :) 

My name is Yichun Song (宋依纯). I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics, the Ohio State University. My research interest focuses in <b> empirical industrial organization, computational method and applied econometrics</b>. 

My advisors are [Adam Dearing](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/aed237/) and [Matthew Weinberg](https://sites.google.com/site/matthewcweinberg/matthew-weinbergs-website). 

Born in Xi'an, China, I got my Bachelors' degree on finance from University of International Business and Economics, Beijing, China. After that, I began my study in the US at Vanderbilt University for a master degree in economics development.
