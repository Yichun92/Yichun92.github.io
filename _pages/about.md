Hello, welcome to my personal website! :) 

My name is Yichun Song (宋依纯). I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics, the Ohio State University. My research lies broadly across Industrial Organization, Applied Econometrics and Algorithms. My research interest focuses in developing new models/methodologies for IO-related topics and models with endogeneity. My advisors are Adam Dearing and Matthew Weinberg. 

Born in Xi'an, China, I got my Bachelors' degree from University of International Business and Economics, Beijing, China. After that, I began my study in the US successively at Vanderbilt University and the Ohio State University.
