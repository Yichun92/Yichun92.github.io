[1] Bargaining, Merger and Endogenous Network Formation: the case of power plants and coal companies in the US (JMP)  

**Abstact:** The outcome of a structural change, for instance, merger, entry, or exit, is a critical task in anti-trust economics. To get a more reasonable market outcome with privately-negotiated transactions, I include non-purchased goods as the threat of replacement. Buyers decide where to purchase and how much to purchase simultaneously. Built on the seminal works on endogenous network formation, I develop a complete structural model in this study, incorporating individual-level Nash bargaining, endogenous network formation, capacity constraints, and multiple continuous purchase behavior. I discuss the identification, implementation, and computational algorithms for estimation and counterfactual. Then I construct a comprehensive data set of power plants and coal companies from 1998 to 2008 to study the Arch-Triton merger in 2005. FTC initially challenged the Arch-Triton merger, and the case was closed, followed by a suspicious spot price increase afterward. I estimate the model with the data set and carry on counterfactual analysis with no merger or divestiture. It turns out that the inclusion of more primitives into the model complicates the analysis and generates ambiguous results.
