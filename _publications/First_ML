Abstract: Based on the fast development in machine learning techniques, we propose a semi-parametric two-stage estimator to solve the endogeneity problem in models where the usual linear-IV is not possible. Those models include binary discrete choice with endogenous regressors, and multinomial Logit model with zero market share. Our first stage is a flexible estimation of the expected outcomes, conditional on both the regressors and instruments. The second stage is a simple linear-IV regression with first-stage results inserted. By construction, after adding an analytical-calculated correction term, the first-stage error up to $o(N^{-1/4})$ has no effect on the asymptotic distribution of the second stage structural parameter estimates, allowing for a variety of non-parametric methods in the first stage. We demonstrate the behavior of our estimator through a pile of simulations. Moreover, we provide a simple application using a comprehensive transaction data between coal mining companies and coal-fired power plants in the US.
