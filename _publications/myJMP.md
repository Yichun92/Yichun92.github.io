Abstract: The results of structural change, for instance, merger, and entry or exit, is an important task in anti-trust economics. To get a more reasonable market outcome where transactions are negotiated by individual bargaining, it is important to allow for currently non-purchased goods entering as the threat of replacement, and buyers make decisions both on where to purchase and how much to purchase. Based on the seminal work by Ho and Lee (2019), and Ghili (2021), I develop a full structural model, incorporating individual-level Nash bargaining, endogenous network formation, suppliersâ€™ capacity constraints, and multiple continuous purchase behavior. I discuss the identification, implementation, and computational algorithms for both estimation and counterfactual. Then I construct a comprehensive data set for the power plants (buyers) and coal companies (suppliers), from 1998 to 2008, and use the model to study a merger -- Arch-Triton merger occurred in 2005, which were challenged by FTC when proposed, and followed with a suspicious spot price increase for all buyers afterward. Using those data, I calculated the full model, and do the corresponding counterfactual analysis with the cases of no-merger and no-divestiture.
